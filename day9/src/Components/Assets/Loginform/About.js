     Wildlife tourism mostly encompasses non-consumptive interactions with wildlife,
     such as observing and photographing animals in their natural habitats.
     It also includes viewing of and interacting with captive animals in zoos or wildlife parks, 
     and can also include animal-riding (e.g. elephant riding) and consumptive activities such as fishing and hunting, 
     which will generally not come under the definition of ecotourism and may compromise animal welfare. 
     It has the recreational aspects of adventure travel, and usually supports the values of ecotourism and nature conservation programs.
