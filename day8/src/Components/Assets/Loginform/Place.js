    <p>Pine trees are a type of evergreen coniferous tree that belong to the genus Pinus, which is part of the Pinaceae family.These forests occur at elevations of 7,000-8,500 feet.
    Pine forests usually occur on dry slopes so needles that fall under the trees decompose very slowly. This thick layer of pine needles is another factor that reduces the understory vegetation.
    These trees are known for their distinctive needle-like leaves, which are usually bundled in clusters, and their woody cones that contain seeds.</p>
